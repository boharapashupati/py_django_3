# 1.	What is bitwise operator. with one example in python?
#ans:  Bitwise operators are special operators in programming that perform operations directly on the binary representation of numbers (bits: 0 and 1).
a = 4
b = 3
print(a&b)  # Perform bitwise AND (# output = 0 )

# 2. What is != operator with example?
# ans: "!= means 'not equal to.' It is a comparison operator that checks if two values are not equal to each other."
a= 4
b = 3
print(a != b) #True
# returns True because 4 is not equal to 3
